## About
This project draws inspiration from the official Line accounts of makeup brands. It combines virtual makeup try-on with personalized cosmetic recommendations, aiming to provide users with a sophisticated and convenient makeup experience.

The virtual makeup component draws reference from Jose Luis Verdugo's Virtual Makeup (OpenCV + Face Landmarks) project. The mask and contouring values have been adjusted to better suit Eastern facial features.
